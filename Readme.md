# Data Mining Algorithms

## This repository contains example of some data mining algorithm implemented using library in Python programming language


- For Apriori, we have used *mlxtend* libray, for which we need to install it using command  `pip install mlxtend`

- For Frequent Pattern(FP) Growth also, we used *mlxtend* library

- For KMeans, we used *sklearn* library

- Similarly for KMediods, we used *sklearn* library
